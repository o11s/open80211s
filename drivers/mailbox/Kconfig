menuconfig MAILBOX
	bool "Mailbox Hardware Support"
	help
	  Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
	  on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
	  signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

config PL320_MBOX
	bool "ARM PL320 Mailbox"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  An implementation of the ARM PL320 Interprocessor Communication
	  Mailbox (IPCM), tailored for the Calxeda Highbank. It is used to
	  send short messages between Highbank's A9 cores and the EnergyCore
	  Management Engine, primarily for cpufreq. Say Y here if you want
	  to use the PL320 IPCM support.

config OMAP1_MBOX
       tristate "OMAP1 Mailbox framework support"
       depends on ARCH_OMAP1
       help
         Mailbox implementation for OMAP chips with hardware for
         interprocessor communication involving DSP in OMAP1. Say Y here
         if you want to use OMAP1 Mailbox framework support.

config OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
       tristate "OMAP2+ Mailbox framework support"
       depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
       help
         Mailbox implementation for OMAP family chips with hardware for
         interprocessor communication involving DSP, IVA1.0 and IVA2 in
         OMAP2/3; or IPU, IVA HD and DSP in OMAP4. Say Y here if you want
         to use OMAP2+ Mailbox framework support.

config DBX500_MBOX
	tristate "DBx500 Mailbox driver support"
	depends on ARCH_U8500
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use DBx500 Mailbox driver support for
	  power coprocessor access on Ux500 and Ux540 families

config MBOX_KFIFO_SIZE
       int "Mailbox kfifo default buffer size (bytes)"
       default 256
       help
         Specify the default size of mailbox's kfifo buffers (bytes).
         This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
         module parameter).

config MBOX_DATA_SIZE
	int "Mailbox associated data max size (bytes)"
	default 64 if DBX500_MBOX
	default 4
	help
	  Specify the default size of mailbox's associated data buffer
	  (bytes)
          This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
          module parameter).
